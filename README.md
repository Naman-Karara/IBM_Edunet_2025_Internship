## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Researchers and academic writers often face significant challenges when creating diagrams in LaTeX, especially using the TikZ package. Writing TikZ code manually is time-consuming, requires technical expertise, and is prone to errors. This slows down the research documentation process and creates a steep learning curve for those unfamiliar with LaTeX graphics. There is a strong need for a user-friendly, intelligent tool that can simplify and automate this task.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

I propose an AI-powered intelligent agent that automatically converts natural language descriptions and sketches into professional TikZ code for LaTeX documents. This agent will support real-time feedback, accept refinement commands in plain English, and produce publication-ready diagrams, eliminating the need for manual coding and significantly enhancing productivity for academic researchers.

## TECHNOLOGY USED

IBM cloud lite services  
Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)  
IBM Granite model  

## IBM CLOUD SERVICES USED

IBM Cloud Watsonx AI Studio  
IBM Cloud Watsonx AI runtime  
IBM Cloud service   
IBM Granite (via watsonx.ai studio)  
IBM Cloud Object Storage IBM AI Tools  

## **ðŸ”§ Prerequisites**  

To use or replicate this project, please follow the steps below:

**1. Create an IBM Cloud account**  

Sign up or log in at cloud.ibm.com.

if you don't have premium, you should have **lite** version of IBM Cloud

**2. Navigate to the Agent Lab (beta)**

Open the Navigation Menu on the left side of the dashboard.

Go to watsonx â†’ watsonx.ai â†’ Gen AI Solutions.

Click on Automating Tasks with AI Agents.

Scroll down and select Agent Lab (beta).

**3. Access the watsonx.ai Studio**  

In the Agent Lab (beta) page, click on the watsonx.ai Home Page link.

Launch the watsonx.ai Studio.

**4. Create a Sandbox Project**

Inside the studio, click Create Project and select the Sandbox option.

**5. Build Your AI Agent**  

Go to the Build AI Agent section.

**Provide the required details:**  

Name of the agent

Description

Instructions

Select a foundation model -> IBM Granite-3.3-8B instruct

Choose the necessary tools(which are essentials for lite version)

**You're all set!**  

Your AI agent is now ready for testing and deployment.

## TikZ Code to Diagram generation 

Register or Sign in on "OverLeaf" website.

Copy the TikZ code which is generated by Agent and paste here,
it will show like this..

## Conclusion

 Simplifies Complex Tasks: Eliminates the need to manually write TikZ code by converting natural language or sketches into LaTeX diagrams.

 Boosts Research Productivity: Saves time and effort for researchers, students, and educators by automating high-quality diagram generation.

 Enhances Accessibility: Makes professional diagram creation accessible to non-technical users with real-time feedback and plain English commands.

## Future scope

**Voice-to-Diagram Generation**  
Enable hands-free diagram creation using speech-to-text for accessibility and faster interaction.  
**Multilingual Support**  
Accept input and commands in multiple languages to support global researchers.  
**Overleaf Integration**  
Direct integration with Overleaf for real-time diagram preview and editing within LaTeX environments.  
**Auto-Diagram Suggestions**  
Automatically suggest diagrams based on surrounding LaTeX text or content analysis.  
**Collaborative Editing**  
Allow multiple users to co-edit and refine diagrams in real time for group research projects.  
**AI-Powered Diagram Optimization**  
Intelligent suggestions for better layout, aesthetics, and labeling of diagrams.  
**Export to Multiple Formats**  
Support PNG, SVG, and PDF exports alongside TikZ for broader use in presentations and publications.
